# SteaScreeLoaded

SteaScreeLoaded is a fork of the tool SteaScree, which helps to upload screenshots to Steam that were not taken using the Steam overlay. Since the original developer no longer maintains this project, I am attempting to update the programme, fix some bugs, and possibly add a few improvements.

# Old Readme of the previous developer:
# This is no longer maintained. Who knows maybe I'll motivate myself enough and build the web-based SteaScree 2 at some point!

## SteaScree: Steam Cloud Screenshot Uploader

SteaScree is a simple cross-platform open-source utility app, which makes screenshots, taken without the use of Steam's in-game overlay, uploadable to the Steam Cloud. You just pick pics, a game and SteaScree will do the rest.

**Developer's note**: I am sorry I was unable to motivate myself to improve this app in recent years. The thing is, I don't feel like learning Qt and the build process for different platforms is a bit cumbersome. That's why I don't feel like Qt is a way to go, well... not anymore. I am thinking about rewriting SteaScree for a browser, that is in JavaScript using [File System Access API](https://wicg.github.io/file-system-access), but that'll obviously take time.
